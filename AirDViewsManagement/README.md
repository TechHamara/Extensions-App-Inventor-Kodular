# Extensions Views Management

Extension name: AirdViewsManagement

This extension makes it easy to manage the opening and closing, and therefore the visibility, of the different views, including a history.

The extension gives the possibility of opening several predefined views in one block during initialization, either by the name of the view or by its position in the initialization list.

In addition, the history provided allows you to go back to previous views (either by an event or by the BACK key)
